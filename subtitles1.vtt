 00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
First of all, I would like to thank Shaqra University

 00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To host the meeting of the College of Applied Medical Sciences at the University of Saudi Arabia today

 00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We truly thank them for the warm welcome and hospitality we received

 00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The committee meets several times a year

 00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
To discuss important topics and exchange experiences, expertise and successful practices between colleges

 00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In today's meeting, there was an effort to limit the existing academic programs

 00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In these colleges, we worked to form or discuss the formation of the University of Specialization

 00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I have really high standards and care about discussing topics at the specialty level

 00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Of course, we hope to come up with recommendations, God willing, that will serve these specializations and serve the students of the Kingdom.
